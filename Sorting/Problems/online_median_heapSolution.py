    Problem:
    Given a list of numbers, the task is to insert these numbers into a stream and find the median of the stream after each insertion. 
    If the median is a non-integer, consider itâ€™s floor value.
    The median of a sorted array is defined as the middle element when the number of elements is odd and the mean of the middle two elements when the number of elements is even.
